We are searching for a Postdoc (2.5 years) for several scientific projects (especially [Solve-RD](http://solve-rd.eu)), with the major focus being ontologies & genomics. You may also work on projects related to natural language processing. We would like to apply methods from machine learning, so experience in that field would be good. 

You *shall* be a Java programmer. 

It would be *cool* if you already know about knowledge representation (ontologies) and genomics.

It would be *nice* if you knew about R, git, machine learning, and statistics.


Be reminded, that it is not a problem if you are not an expert in all of the above fields, but you need to be willing to learn about them.

Please send your CV with 2 references to sebastian.koehler@charite.de.
