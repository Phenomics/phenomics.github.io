We are searching for a Postdoc (2.5 years) for several scientific projects (especially [Solve-RD](http://solve-rd.eu)), with the major focus being ontologies, genomics, natural language processing and machine learning. 

You *shall* be a Java programmer. 

It would be *cool* if you already know about knowledge representation and genomics.

It would be *nice* if you knew about R, git, machine learning, and statistics.

Please send your CV with 2 references to sebastian.koehler@charite.de.
