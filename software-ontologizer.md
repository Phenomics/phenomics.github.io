The Ontologizer is a tool for the statistical analysis and visualization of 
high-throughput biological data using Gene Ontology. The project's homepage 
is located at [http://ontologizer.de/](http://ontologizer.de/). We contribute 
to the code at [our fork on github](https://github.com/drseb/ontologizer).
