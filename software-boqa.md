The Bayesian Ontology Query Algorithm (BOQA) integrates the knowledge stored in an ontology and the accompanying annotations into a Bayesian network in order to implement a search system in which users enter one or more terms of the ontology to get a list of appropriate domain items. This is the companion Website to the original Bioinformatics publication. Here, we provide an implementation as well as the Benchmark procedure.
