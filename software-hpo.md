The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is developed by our group and [Robinson group](https://robinsongroup.github.io/). The HPO aims to provide a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease. Terms in the HPO describe individual phenotypic abnormalities such as <i>atrial septal defect</i>.
